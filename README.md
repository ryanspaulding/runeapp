# Runeapp 
A web based app to show information about the Furthark (Runes). This app was designed for the iPhone but works great on the iPad, and computer screens. The goal of this project is to support N devices and look and feel like a native app with HTML and CSS markup! Also to have a way for me to study the runes from anywhere. 

## Current Features (version 1.5)
- view all runes
- short description of each rune
- works well on tablets, smartphones and desktop browsers
- cast runes 
- runes drawn via javascript and the canvas tag
- entire site is under 10k zipped (not including jQuery)

## Roadmap

### 2.0
- create a better design 
- do feature detection and display images when the canvas tag is not supported 
- make the #runename actually go to that rune so people can bookmark the rune

### 3.0  
- descriptions 
- change descriptions with local storage
