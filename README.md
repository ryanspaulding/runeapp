# Runeapp 
A web based app to show information about the Furthark (Runes). This app was designed for the iPhone but works great on the iPad, and computer screens. The goal of this project is to support N devices and look and feel like a native app with HTML and CSS markup! Also to have a way for me to study the runes where ever I am. 


## Roadmap

### 1.0 
- cache whole app on phone
- tablet images
- phone images
- swipe gestures
- images of each rune w/ names


### 2.0  
- descriptions 
- change descriptions with local storage
- better images or maybe a way to select different runes. Like default, brushed metal, etc
